## In Plain Language

This study explores how creditors respond to companies’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emission behaviors — specifically, their reduction efforts and disclosure transparency.  
We find that creditors reward firms that actively reduce emissions and publicly report their performance, granting them lower borrowing costs and better access to financing.  
The findings suggest that environmental accountability not only supports sustainability goals but also enhances financial credibility and trust in capital markets.

## Paper Highlight: 
| Why it matters | What the paper delivers |
|---|---|
| **Credit markets price carbon risk.** When lenders perceive lower climate risk, they reward firms with cheaper loans. | **A finance–carbon systems model.** Using simultaneous SEM + 3SLS, the study teases apart how GHG performance and assured disclosure jointly (and separately) influence cost of debt. |
| **Decision-makers need credible evidence, not boiler-plate.** Detailed, project-level data help outsiders judge future emissions. | **Detail + assurance lower borrowing costs.** Granular information about multiple reduction projects—when externally assured—significantly improves credit ratings. |
| **High-impact sectors carry bigger financing penalties.** Carbon-intensive industries face tougher scrutiny from banks and investors. | **Sector lens.** Effects are strongest in environmentally sensitive industries, helping managers focus efforts where financing gains are largest. |
| **Financing can fuel further abatement.** Understanding the feedback loop is key to scaling decarbonisation investments. | **A virtuous cycle.** Lower cost of debt spurs additional GHG projects, which in turn boost performance—feeding back into cheaper financing. |
| **North-American benchmark.** Regulators and banks need region-specific evidence to calibrate climate-risk models. | **Unique dataset.** 806 firm-years (US & Canada, 2011-14) from CDP reports provide robust, policy-relevant benchmarks. |

### Managerial Takeaways

* **Scale diverse carbon projects.** A larger portfolio of reduction initiatives directly improves GHG performance and is rewarded with lower debt costs.  
* **Obtain external assurance.** Credible, verified emissions data strengthen disclosure quality and further cut financing costs.  
* **Reinvest financing savings.** Use the interest-rate advantage to fund additional carbon projects—reinforcing the finance-performance loop.  
* **Prioritise specificity over volume.** Lenders value clear targets, scope distinctions and progress metrics more than lengthy narratives.  
* **Benchmark by sector.** Carbon-intensive industries gain most from high-quality disclosure—turn scrutiny into a competitive edge.
