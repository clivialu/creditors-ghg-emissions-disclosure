## In plain language

This study explores how creditors respond to companies’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emission behaviors — specifically, their reduction efforts and disclosure transparency.  
We find that creditors reward firms that actively reduce emissions and publicly report their performance, granting them lower borrowing costs and better access to financing.  
The findings suggest that environmental accountability not only supports sustainability goals but also enhances financial credibility and trust in capital markets.
